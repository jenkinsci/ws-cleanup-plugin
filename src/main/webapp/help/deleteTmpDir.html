    <p>
        When using Jenkins Pipelines a temporary directory can be created side by side with the regular workspace ('/workspace/sample-pipeline@tmp'). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Refer to <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-basic-steps/#code-pwd-code-determine-current-directory">Step Reference: pwd</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        If this option is checked, this temporary directory is also cleaned up.
