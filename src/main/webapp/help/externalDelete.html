    <p>If set, an external deletion program will be run against files and directories. </p>

    <p>Syntax:
        <code>
            program_name [program options] %s
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Where program_name is the program to use, path, or environment variable.  
        <code>program options</code> are any switches to send to the program.
        <code>%s</code> will be replaced with the path to be deleted dynamically.
    </p>
    <p>
        An empty string, after environment variable expansion uses the default 
        deletion utility.
    </p>
    <p>
        Environment variables can be used with the following syntax: <code>${env_var}</code>
    </p>        
    <p>
        Examples:
        <pre>
            Unlocker: 
                "C:\Program Files\Unlocker\unlocker.exe" %s /D /S
            
            Unlocker on Windows Nodes:
                ${delete_command}
               
                with the following environment variable defined on windows nodes:
                delete_command = "C:\Program Files\Unlocker\unlocker.exe" %s /D /S

                And on other nodes:
                delete_command = "" (An empty string uses the default functionality)            

            Shred:
                shred -u %s
        </pre>
    </p>
